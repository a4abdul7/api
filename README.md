Resource Group Strategy for S3 Creation in Hydra CloudObjectStore Operator

Based on the Hydra CloudObjectStore Operator documentation, the recommended approach for creating S3 object stores is to use one Resource Group per application.

Rationale:

Separation of Concerns: Allocating a dedicated Resource Group per application allows for better management of object store configurations, such as encryption, access permissions, and bucket policies. This ensures each application can maintain its own settings without interference from others.

Application Ownership: After the object store is created, the application team takes full ownership and responsibility for managing the object store. Having separate Resource Groups for each application ensures clear boundaries and easier management.

Security and Compliance: This approach ensures that security policies, such as access controls and encryption settings, are applied at the application level, helping to meet compliance requirements and preventing the risk of misconfiguration.

Why not other options?:

One Resource Group for All Applications: Using a single Resource Group for all applications could lead to challenges in managing permissions and configurations, making it difficult to maintain clear separation and security across different applications.

One Resource Group per Environment: While this may work in some cases, it doesn't provide the same level of granularity needed for managing app-specific configurations and security policies.

Conclusion:
For better management, security, and scalability, it is recommended to use one Resource Group per application for creating S3 object stores with the Hydra CloudObjectStore Operator.
